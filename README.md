# Sublime Text - Snippets

These are the snippets that I use in all of my installations of Sublime Text.

## Installation

To install the snippets in your sublime, you will have to clone this repo into your own computer(s).

In your terminal, run the following command

```
cd Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/
git clone git@github.com:vicgonvt/snippets.git
```

This will create a directory called `snippets` which will contain all of the snippets. 

That's it! It's that easy.

Enjoy!
